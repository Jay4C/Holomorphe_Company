                  1. The manufacturer of a machine or his agent must ensure that a risk assessment is made to
                  determine the health and safety requirements that apply to the machine. The machine must then be
                  designed and constructed taking into account the results of the risk assessment.
                  Through the iterative process for assessing and reducing the risks referred to above, the
                  manufacturer or his agent:
                  <br>
                  - determines the limits of the machine, including its normal use and any reasonably predictable use,
                  <br>
                  - lists the dangers that may arise from the machine and the associated dangerous situations,
                  <br>
                  - considers the risks, given the severity of a possible injury or undermining the health and
                  probability,
                  <br>
                  - evaluates the risks, with a view to determining whether a risk reduction is necessary,
                  in accordance with the purpose of this Directive,
                  <br>
                  - eliminates the hazards or reduces the risks associated with these hazards by applying protection
                  measures, according to the priority order set out in point 1.1.2 (b).

                  by the manufacturer or his agent, but also in abnormal situations predictable. In any case, the
                  principles of integration of the security covered Section 1.1.2 and the obligations concerning the
                  marking of the machines and the instruction instructions covered section 1.7.3 and 1.7.4 apply.

                  must, as far as possible, be designed and constructed to extend to these objectives.

                  <br>

                  pressure level at workstations exceeds 80 dB(A).
                  <br>
                  These values are either actually measured for the machine in question, or established from
                  measurements made for a technically comparable machine which is representative of the machine to
                  be produced.
                  <br>

                  around the machinery.

                  Where harmonized standards are not applied, noise data shall be measured using the method most
                  appropriate for the machine.
                  <br>
                  When sound emission values are indicated, the uncertainties surrounding these values must be
                  specified.
                  <br>
                  The operating conditions of the machine during the measurement and the methods used for the
                  measurement shall be described.
                  <br>
                  When the workstation(s) are not, or cannot be defined, the A-weighted sound pressure level must
                  be measured at 1 m from the surface of the machine and at a height of 1.60 m above the floor or
                  access platform. The position and the value of the maximum sound pressure must be indicated.
                  <br>
                  Where specific Community directives provide for other requirements for the measurement of sound
                  pressure or power levels, these directives must be applied, and the corresponding requirements
                  of this point do not apply.
                  <br>
                  v) where the machinery is liable to emit non-ionizing radiation which could harm people,
                  in particular people fitted with active or non-active implantable medical devices, information
                  concerning the radiation emitted for the operator and the people exposed.
